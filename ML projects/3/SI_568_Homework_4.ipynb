We will define $V(S)$ to be the set of all possible vectors that we can make this way, i.e. all possible subsets of $S$.\n",

    "    Let $S$ be the set of all unique words in the text above, and lets consider each sentence of the above text data to be one data point. How big is $S?

Store the number of distinct words into 'part_1' for the autograder.\n",

    "2. Do these three vectors span the vector space $V(S)$? (I.e. from these three vectors, could you make any vector in the vector space through addition and scalar multiplication?)  Why or why not? Store 'yes' or 'no' into 'part_2' for the autograder.\n",

We can see that addition is commutative from the definition, since it says that $1+0=0+1$ (and order doesn't matter for $1+1$ and $0+0$). Similarly, the scalar $1$ is the multiplicative identity, as by definition $1\\cdot \\vec{v} = \\vec{v}$. Let us also assume the associative and distributive properties are true (although if you want to show them go for it! I'll include the proofs in the solutions also). Show the additive identity and additive inverse properties for $V(S)$. In other words, explain what the additive identity and the additive inverses should be for this vector space and why they work."
